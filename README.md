# Hilaire Touyem – Data Science & Optimization Portfolio

## About Me
Data Science & Business Analytics graduate with a strong background in applied
mathematics and optimization. I design and implement **data-driven decision
models** in machine learning, analytics, and optimization, with a strong focus on
**interpretability, risk-aware modeling, and real-world business applications**.

## Core Domains
- 📊 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**  
  Predictive modeling (classification, regression), neural networks
  (MLP, CNN, RNN, GAN, VAE), applied NLP and LLM usage, model evaluation,
  and interpretable AI for decision support

- 🚚 **Optimization & Operations Research**  
  Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
  constrained and stochastic optimization

- 📈 **Business Analytics**  
  Power BI, KPI-driven analysis, and decision dashboards

## Featured Projects
- 🏫 **School Dropout Risk Prediction**  
  Interpretable risk prediction model using machine learning and
  SHAP-based explanations to support transparent decision-making
