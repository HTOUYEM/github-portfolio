# School Dropout Risk Prediction  
### Model Selection and Interpretability with SHAP

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting student dropout risk using machine learning models.
Beyond predictive performance, the project emphasizes **model selection** and
**interpretability**, relying on **SHAP values** to understand and justify model predictions.
